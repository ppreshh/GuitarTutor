------------------------

*At the moment, audio for the guitar only works from an open string in standard tuning up to the 7th fret for each string (haven't spent the time to record all the notes in a good treated room yet)*

------------------------

### Current Features

- Identify chords by placing markers to denote where fingers and capo are placed (analyzer algorithm is a WIP)
- Hear what's set with full strums (maybe finger style later)
- Save chords in order to make progressions
- Name those saves, and be able to reload them
- Playback chord progression's chords
- Change tuning
- Share progressions with friends

### Future Features

- Better chord progression playback
- Open a library of chords to show on the fingerboard
- Show suggestions for variations of a chord that's currently set
